        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
          SamayBaji started as an intensive brain storming idea for our
           Bachelorâ€™s 4th semester Project.
           As a Foodie ourselves, (Deepak Sijali & Gabriel Muktan) we really 
           love to eat out in many places. It was only natural for us 
           to fall in love with the Newari Cuisines, we were FAN
            of the Newari food culture since day ONE.
        </p>
       
        <p>
         An idea came across our mind, when we found out that many
         people just like us love Newari food, they love to eat these
        delightful, flavourful and beautifully prepared dishes.
        But the problem was many people just like us had no IDEA 
        whatsoever on how to actually prepare and cook these dishes.
            Many restaurants we visited were way to expensive, and
             sometimes even unhygienic to consume.
            </p>
        <P>
          So, with this idea we started to research and collect data on Newari Food culture. We aim to provide Simple, Authentic and Hygienic recipes that can be prepared in our own kitchen with minimal tools and proper guidance. We also aim to save people their money, instead of eating outside in expensive restaurants people can involve themselves in cooking and enjoy the process of cooking at home.
        </P>
        <P>
          It has been quite an interesting journey to explore, research and ponder upon the great Newa- Culture. We have found out a lot of things that we were unaware of despite growing up inside the valley. 

        </P>
        <p>
          We are Thankful to everyone who helped us during the project, Dhanybad cha Hridaya Dekhi Nai.
